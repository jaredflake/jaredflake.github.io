### *"To Interact or Not? On the Benefits of Interacting with Unfavorable Analysts during Earnings Calls?"* (JMP)

*Revise and Resubmit* at the *Journal of Accounting Research*

Managers prioritize favorable analysts during earnings calls, reinforcing analysts’ incentives for optimism. However, managers also frequently interact with unfavorable analysts, and this study examines the determinants and benefits of these interactions. I find that managers interact more with unfavorable analysts when compelled to do so. I then examine two likely benefits of these interactions. First, unfavorable analysts attenuate their negative views after interacting with managers. Second, price reactions to management forecasts are stronger for managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts, consistent with enhanced reporting credibility. Finally, using peer firm restatements as exogenous shocks to investor’s perceptions of accounting quality, I find that nonrestating firms with managers who regularly interact with unfavorable analysts experience attenuated negative returns relative to other nonrestating peers. Overall, the empirical evidence indicates firms experience significant benefits when managers interact with unfavorable analysts and these benefits persist amongst compelled and voluntary interactions.

### *"The Credibility of Non-Disclosure: Evidence from Real-time Market Response to Non-Answers in Conference Calls"* with Yang Cao and Miao Liu

*Revise and Resubmit* at the *The Accounting Review*

Managers sometimes give non-disclosure to investors despite their best intentions, either due to a lack of information or substantial proprietary costs. However, it is difficult for investors to distinguish these managers from those hiding negative news. This paper investigates whether managers can establish a transparent disclosure reputation to credibly communicate the absence of information, using non-answers during earnings calls as a setting. By matching granular, time-stamped earnings call conversations with high-frequency trading data, we create a novel dataset that examines immediate real-time market reactions to non-answers given by managers. Additionally, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to build a database of strategies that managers adopt to establish a transparent disclosure reputation, including providing detailed elaboration when issuing negative earnings guidance and proactively interacting with bearish analysts. We find that these disclosure strategies bolster managers’ credibility when communicating the absence of information. Our study highlights the importance of disclosure strategies that managers can adopt to ensure credible communication within the dynamic context of real-time scenarios.

### *"The Effect of Analyst Research on Managers’ Merger and Acquisition Decisions: Revising Shareholder Opinions"* with Farzana Afrin and Jalal Sani

Preparing for submission to the *Journal of Accounting Research*

Completing an acquisition with negative announcement returns can have adverse consequences for managers (e.g., forced turnover). Yet, managers complete 91% of such deals. Prior research interprets these deals as evidence of agency motives. We propose a complementary explanation and examine the role of analyst research. We posit that, because of the costs of acquiring and processing information, shareholders may not possess all relevant information at the deal announcement date and subsequently revise their opinions. These revised opinions affect managers’ perceptions of the costs of deviating from shareholders’ initial opinions and their decision to complete the deal. While the effect of analyst research on the likelihood of deal completion is ex-ante unclear, our results suggest that analyst research prompts acquirers’ shareholders to revise their opinions upward, increasing the likelihood of deal completion. This effect is stronger when (i) shareholders are less informed, (ii) the deal quality is relatively high, (iii) analysts are more informed, (iv) agency motivation for completing a deal is lower, and (v) analysts are not affiliated with the acquirer. Overall, our findings highlight the role of analyst research in motivating investors to revise their opinions, thereby influencing corporate investment decisions.

### *"Consequences of Implied Analyst Recommendation Revisions in Reiteration Research Reports"* with Mark Bradshaw, Chad Hamm, and Mark Piorkowski

Preparing for submission to *The Accounting Review*

Over 90% of analysts’ stock recommendations reiterate prior recommendations, but most research on recommendations examines the small subset of actual revisions. Analysts are reluctant to revise recommendations and other forecasts, either to placate managers or avoid a pattern of ‘see-saw’ research outputs. We predict that an analyst may signal a change in sentiment without actually revising the outstanding recommendation. Indeed, we show that reiterations we identify as “implied recommendation revisions” predict actual future recommendation revisions. The market impounds such information into prices—implied upgrades (downgrades) are positively (negatively) associated with returns centered on the report date, and price reactions to actual recommendation revisions are attenuated when preceded by an implied recommendation revision. We also show that sophisticated investors are more likely to trade after implied recommendation revisions, whereas retail traders tend to trade around actual recommendation revisions. Overall, our evidence provides extended insight into analysts’ research, the dynamics of recommendations, and the market consequences of both recommendation reiterations and revisions.

<!-- ### Future Work

Some topics that I hope to explore in the future include the role of corporate disclosures in managing climate and sustainability efforts as well as the use of accounting information by less traditional stakeholders such as consumers and employees. I am very interested in the risks posed by climate change as well as the movement towards sustainability and inclusion. Given the increasing supply and access of accounting information as well as the rapidly evolving regulatory and disclosure landscape with respect to climate goals, I feel that research on these topics is compelling and has the potential to answer questions of economic significance. -->
